Here is the initial prompt we used for the code: 

I want to build an app using vanilla javascript, css, and html.  Please be concise but make it interesting -- make it some sort of game that will be engaging -- and if it isnt too difficult, make it multiplayer, so that if two people visit the same server they can see eachother to some degree.  Just provide .js .css and .html files
